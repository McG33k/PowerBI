Introduction:
In today's fast-paced world, air travel has become an indispensable aspect of our daily lives, connecting people and businesses across the globe. Whether it's for business networking, commercial transactions, or personal visits to loved ones, the aviation industry plays a pivotal role in our interconnected world.
However, this industry is no stranger to challenges and uncertainties. It constantly faces a dynamic landscape shaped by various external factors, such as economic fluctuations, climate change, global health crises like the Covid-19 pandemic, and an increasing emphasis on renewable energy sources.
Understanding and adapting to these changes is essential for comprehending the impact they have on air travel. Thus, there is a pressing need to monitor and analyze flight data over time. This ambitious undertaking calls for a robust approach to data warehousing, data analysis, and data visualization, all of which will be central to our US Flight Analysis project in Power BI. By harnessing the power of data, we aim to gain valuable insights into the trends and patterns that shape the aviation industry, enabling informed decision-making and preparing us for a more resilient and efficient future of air travel.
